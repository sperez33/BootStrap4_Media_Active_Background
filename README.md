# BootStrap_Challenge

Challenge number 2 given to me by my manager

June.25.2019 - 10:00a - Created a template mimicking the one from the youtube tutorial "How to set Image in Jumbotron
using Bootstrap and CSS" by Learning Simplified.

June.25.2019 - 2:31p - made a drastic update and used a template from https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/video-header/ 
and overlapped a little bit with the old basic template

June.26.2019 - 8:35a - added an external css page, couldn't figure out a way to do it with bootstrap exclusively but it's
very minimal external css. When in mobile mode, it shows an image instead of the video clip in the background.
